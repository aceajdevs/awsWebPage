                Hello, my name is Jonah Smith. I am a senior software engineer here at Kennesaw State University. 
                In my free time I like working on my passion projects and working out. I also enjoy hiking and playing volleyball as well.
                I am excited to learn more about cloud computing and AWS through this course.
